    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 eggplant</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>

      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger</li>

      <li>1 large tomato — peeled, seeded, and diced</li>

      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>

      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven's broiler. Rub oil on the outside of the eggplant or
        coat it with cooking spray. Place under the broiler, and cook until the
        flesh is soft and the skin is blistering off, about 30 minutes. Turn as
        needed for even cooking. Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise, and scoop
        the flesh out of the skin. Discard the skin; chop up the flesh, and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the
        cumin seeds, and let them crackle for a few seconds and turn golden
        brown. Be careful not to burn them. Add the onion, ginger, and garlic;
        cook and stir until tender. Stir in the tomato, and season with
        turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, salt, and
        black pepper. Cook and stir for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the eggplant pieces in the skillet, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes
        so some of the moisture evaporates. Taste, and adjust seasonings if
        desired. Garnish with fresh cilantro, and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
